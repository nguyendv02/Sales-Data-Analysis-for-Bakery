# Sales-Data-Analysis-for-Bakery

## Overview
This study utilizes sales data from a bakery over the course of a year to analyze trends and customer habits, aiming to devise strategies to boost revenue.

Data includes:
- TransactionNo: Invoice number
- Items: Items purchased by customers
- DateTime: Purchase timestamp
- Daypart: Part of the day (e.g., morning, afternoon)
- DayType: Weekday or weekend

We add some additional columns such as day of the week, month, and year to provide more detailed statistical insights.

From the four charts above, we observe the following:
- Weekends generate higher revenue compared to other days, with Saturday being the highest.
- The last and first months of the year (from November to March) show superior revenue compared to other months.
- Customers predominantly visit during the afternoon (56.4%), followed by the morning (41%), and least during the evening and night.
- Coffee, Sandwich, Tea, Cake, and Pastry are the most preferred items by customers.

## Insights from data

We need to aggregate individual data into transactions to analyze trends and customer habits effectively. From these insights, we can launch campaigns that hit the spot with what customers like.

For this project, we're using this thing called the Apriori algorithm to figure out how different items that customers buy are connected. And guess what? After crunching the numbers, turns out:
- Coffee is the clear favorite, showing up in all of the top 14 combos. In addition, about 52.7% of cake fans go for Coffee, and 53.2% of sandwich lovers do too.
- Apart from the dominance of Coffee, another notable preference is that Bread lovers tend to purchase Pastry or Tea, both combos hitting around 8%."
